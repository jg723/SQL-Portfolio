# SQL-Portfolio

This portfolio contains examples of SQL used to analyze a movie rental company's database. A review and cleaning of the data were conducted, as well as a few deep dives into multi-table queries using various methods such as CTE and subqueries. The main questions involved included:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
